    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nepali buff momos are a beloved dumpling dish made with buffalo meat, widely enjoyed as a snack or meal in Nepal. To prepare the filling, finely minced buffalo meat is mixed with chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, fresh coriander, and warming spices like cumin, coriander powder, and turmeric. A small amount of oil and sometimes soy sauce or momo masala is added to keep the mixture juicy and flavorful. Meanwhile, a simple dough is made by kneading all-purpose flour with water until soft and elastic, then left to rest before rolling into thin circles.</p>
    <p>Once the dough and filling are ready, a spoonful of the meat mixture is placed in the center of each wrapper. The edges are carefully pleated and sealed into round or half-moon shapes. The momos are then steamed in a momo steamer (or an improvised setup using a pot and rack) for about 10 to 12 minutes, until the wrappers turn glossy and translucent. They are traditionally served hot with a spicy tomato-based dipping sauce called achar, making them both comforting and deeply flavorful.</p>

        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Preparing the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix flour and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water and knead into a soft, smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Cover and let it rest for 20–30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine minced buffalo meat, onion, garlic, ginger, chilies, and coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Add cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric, oil, and salt.</li>
        <li>Mix well by hand until everything is evenly combined (the mixture should feel slightly sticky and moist).</li>
        <li>Optional: add momo masala and soy sauce for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol> 
    <h3>Shaping the Momos</h3>  
    <ol> 
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a walnut).</li>
        <li>Roll each ball into a thin, round wrapper about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place 1 spoonful of filling in the center of each wrapper.</li>
        <li>Fold and pleat the edges to seal (round, half-moon, or any shape you prefer).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking the Momos</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly oil a steamer tray to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Arrange the momos in the tray, leaving space between them.</li>
        <li>Steam over boiling water for 10–12 minutes, or until the wrappers turn glossy and translucent.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Serve hot with spicy tomato achar (dipping sauce).</li>
    </ol>

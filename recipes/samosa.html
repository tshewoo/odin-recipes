    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Veg samosas are one of the most popular South Asian snacks, known for their crisp, golden pastry shell and flavorful spiced vegetable filling. The dish begins with a dough made from all-purpose flour, oil or ghee, and water, which is kneaded into a firm texture perfect for frying. The filling is usually a mixture of boiled potatoes, peas, onions, and green chilies, seasoned with aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Together, the flaky crust and savory filling create a satisfying balance of textures and flavors that make samosas beloved across India, Nepal, and beyond.</p>
    <p>Once the filling and dough are prepared, small portions of dough are rolled out, shaped into cones, and stuffed with the spiced vegetable mixture. The cones are sealed and deep-fried slowly over medium heat until crisp and golden brown. Samosas are often enjoyed hot, served with tangy tamarind chutney, spicy green chutney, or even tomato achar. Whether eaten as a street food snack, an appetizer, or part of a festive meal, veg samosas are a timeless comfort food that bring together warmth, crunch, and spice in every bite.</p>

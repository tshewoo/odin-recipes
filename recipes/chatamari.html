    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buff chatamari, often called the "Nepali pizza," is a traditional Newar dish made with a rice flour base and topped with spiced buffalo meat. The recipe begins by preparing a smooth batter from rice flour and water, which is then spread thinly onto a heated, lightly greased pan to form a crepe-like base. As the batter cooks, it firms up into a soft yet slightly crispy layer. The topping is prepared separately by mixing minced buffalo meat with chopped onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, coriander, and spices such as cumin, coriander powder, and turmeric, creating a fragrant and savory mixture.</p>
    <p>Once the rice crepe is half-cooked, the seasoned buffalo topping is spread evenly across the surface, often with a beaten egg cracked on top for added richness. The chatamari is then covered and cooked until the meat is fully done and the base develops a light golden edge. Served hot, buff chatamari is enjoyed as a flavorful snack or meal, offering a unique balance of textures between the tender rice crepe and the spiced meat topping, making it a cherished part of Newar cuisine.</p>

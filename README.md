# odin-recipes
This is an exercise where I will be using foundational HTML skills that I have acquired through the Odin Project Foundations Course to create a basic recipe website. 
To build the website, I will be using various skills and elements such as - using the command line and GitHub, basic HTML boilerplate, link and text elements, to name a few.
